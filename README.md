## OptiTools

### Description

  This Package contains Matlab routines for optimization. They are divided in three categories:
1. **Operators**  : constructs operators (*e.g.* convolution, gradient ...)
2. **Functional** : constructs objective functional (*e.g.* least square functional, norms ...) to minimize. They can be combined                       with operators
3. **Algorithms** : optimization algorithms which can be used to minimize the constructed functional

### Get started

  In order to use this package, you need to download all the files (and folders), put them in the location that you want, and run the *install.m* script
  ```
  >> install
  ```
  which will update your Matlab path variable with the new directories. (*Note* you must be in root mode to run this installation script)
