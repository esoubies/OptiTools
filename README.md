## OptiTools
### Description
  This Package contains Matlab routines for optimization. There is 4 folders:
  
1. **Operators**: constructs operators (*e.g.* convolution, gradient ...),
2. **Functionals**: constructs objective functional (*e.g.* least square functional, norms ...) to minimize. They can be combined                       with operators,
3. **Algorithms**: optimization algorithms which can be used to minimize the constructed functional,
4. **Examples**: some examples showing how to use this material are provided.

### Get started
  In order to use this package, you need to download all the files (and folders), put them at the wanted location, and run the *install.m* script:
  ```
  >> install
  ```
  which will update your Matlab path variable with the new directories. (*Note : you must be in root mode to run this installation script*).
